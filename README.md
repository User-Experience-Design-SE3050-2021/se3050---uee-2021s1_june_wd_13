## Designing Application

We have chosen [SingerCare](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.singercare&hl=en&gl=US) App as our UEE project. This app is created by Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC to provide quick services to their customers. The main purpose of this app is to connect customers and customer service employers. Basically, Singer customers can place a service request through this app, and on the other hand, an employer will get that request.
